1. Need to implement visualization of images during the process.
2. Print out the accuracy for easier understanding and debugging.
3. Run the code in the machines in the lab and see the performance for training.
4. Add more fully connected layers and see the performance.
5. Augmentation of images as required.
6. Save and restore model functionality.
7. Visualize the failure cases. Some graph that can provide inferences of the cases.
